      '<p>Once you’ve absorbed the architectural marvel of Kyoto Station, head a few blocks west to find <a href="https://www.kurasu.kyoto/" class="addbackground">Kurasu Kyoto</a>—a stellar example of the way Kyoto blends tradition with the modern. Kurasu is small, but the cafe’s open and clean layout keeps you from feeling cramped. Traditional stonework floors are trafficked by patrons holding pour-overs, and the white ash counters make a good home for a matte black <a href="http://www.lamarzoccousa.com/portfolio/lineapb/" class="addbackground">La Marzocco Linea PB</a>.</p><p>Before a physical location was developed, Kurasu found its place in the coffee community by selling curated Japanese coffee-ware online, and later as a subscription service featuring Japanese roasters. Now in the real world, Kurasu Kyoto is part cafe and part showroom for the team’s favorite coffee tools and beans.
